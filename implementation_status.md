# User Role Management Implementation Progress Report

## What's Done
1. ✅ Created the `UserRoleService` class
2. ✅ Updated the `User` model to work with multiple roles
3. ✅ Modified the `UserController` to use the new role system
4. ✅ Updated the `AccountController` for authentication with roles
5. ✅ Created necessary SQL stored procedures

## What's Still Needed
1. ⏳ Fix compilation errors in `RoleManagementController` and `UserManagementController`
2. ⏳ Update views to work with the new role system
3. ⏳ Create new views for role management
4. ⏳ Update `Program.cs` to register the new services
5. ⏳ Execute the SQL scripts to update the database schema

## Key Compilation Errors
The main compilation errors that need to be addressed:

1. In `UserManagementController.cs`:
   ```csharp
   'UserRoleService' does not contain a definition for 'SetUserRolesAsync'
   'UserRoleService' does not contain a definition for 'GetRolesForUserAsync'
   ```

2. In `RoleManagementController.cs`:
   ```csharp
   Cannot deconstruct a tuple of '3' elements into '2' variables.
   Cannot implicitly convert type '(bool Success, string Message)' to 'bool'
   'UserRoleService' does not contain a definition for 'GetAllUsersWithRoleStatusAsync'
   'UserRoleService' does not contain a definition for 'SetUsersForRoleAsync'
   ```

3. In `AccountController.cs`:
   ```csharp
   'AuthUser' does not contain a definition for 'Id'
   'AuthService' does not contain a definition for 'RegisterUserAsync'
   'bool' does not contain a definition for 'success'
   'bool' does not contain a definition for 'message'
   'AuthService' does not contain a definition for 'GetUsersAsync'
   Cannot convert method group 'Count' to non-delegate type 'int'
   'AuthService' does not contain a definition for 'GetUserForEditAsync'
   'AuthService' does not contain a definition for 'UpdateUserAsync'
   ```

4. In various views and controllers:
   ```csharp
   'User' does not contain a definition for 'Role'
   'UserRole' does not contain a definition for 'Guest'
   'UserRole' does not contain a definition for 'CRMMarketing'
   ```

## Next Steps
To resolve these issues:

1. Add the missing methods to `UserRoleService` or update the controllers to use the existing methods
2. Update the `UserRole` enum to a proper database-backed model
3. Update views to work with the new role system
4. Ensure the necessary services are registered in `Program.cs`
5. Run the SQL scripts to update the database schema

## How to Test
Once the compilation errors are fixed:
1. Run the SQL scripts to create the necessary tables and stored procedures
2. Start the application
3. Navigate to `/UserManagement` to manage users and roles
4. Verify that users can be assigned multiple roles
5. Verify that roles can be assigned to multiple users
6. Test authentication with different roles
