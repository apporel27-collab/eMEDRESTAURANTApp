# Restaurant Management System: User Workflows

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the user workflows within the Restaurant Management System. It details how different users interact with the system based on their roles, responsibilities, and day-to-day operational tasks.

Each user role has specific workflows tailored to their responsibilities within the restaurant ecosystem.

## 3. Authentication Workflow

### 3.1. Login Process

1. User navigates to the login page
2. User enters credentials (username and password)
3. System authenticates the user
4. If Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled:
   - System prompts for additional verification
   - User provides the required second factor
5. Upon successful authentication:
   - User is redirected to the appropriate dashboard
   - System loads permissions based on user role
   - Session is established with appropriate timeout
