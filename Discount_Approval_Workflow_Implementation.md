# Discount Approval Workflow Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive discount approval workflow that ensures any payment with discount requires approval before being marked as completed (Status = 1).

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Discount Detection**
- System automatically detects when discount amount > 0 during payment processing
- Any payment with discount is flagged for approval workflow

### 2. **Force Pending Status for Discounts**
- When discount is applied, payment status is automatically set to 0 (Pending)
- This happens regardless of payment method's RequiresApproval setting
- Overrides normal payment approval logic for discount scenarios

### 3. **Clear User Feedback**
- **With Discount**: "Payment with discount of ₹15.00 requires approval. It has been saved as pending."
- **Without Discount**: Standard approval message for other pending payments

### 4. **Proper GST Calculation**
- Discount applies to subtotal (before GST)
- GST recalculated on discounted amount
- Database stores exact payment amount after discount and GST calculation

## Technical Implementation

### Payment Processing Flow:
1. **Calculate Correct Amounts**:
   - Original Subtotal: ₹300
   - Apply Discount: ₹300 - ₹15 = ₹285
   - Calculate GST: ₹285 × 5% = ₹14.25
   - Final Payment: ₹285 + ₹14.25 = ₹299.25

2. **Payment Status Management**:
   - Payment initially created through stored procedure
   - If discount > 0 AND status = 1 (approved), force to status = 0 (pending)
   - Add note: "Discount applied - requires approval"

3. **Order Update**:
   - Update order with new discount amount
   - Recalculate tax amount based on discounted subtotal
   - Update total amount accordingly

### Database Changes:
- **Payments.Status = 0**: Pending approval (when discount applied)
- **Payments.Status = 1**: Approved (only after manual approval)
- **Payments.Notes**: Includes discount approval requirement note
- **Orders.DiscountAmount**: Updated with accumulated discounts
- **Orders.TaxAmount**: Recalculated on discounted subtotal
- **Orders.TotalAmount**: Updated total after discount and tax recalculation

## Approval Workflow Process

### For Staff:
1. **Payment Entry**: Staff enters payment amount and discount
2. **System Response**: "Payment with discount of ₹15.00 requires approval. It has been saved as pending."
3. **Order Status**: Remains active until payment approved

### For Manager/Supervisor:
1. **Dashboard Access**: Visit Payment Dashboard to see pending payments
2. **Review Discount**: See payment details including discount amount
3. **Approval Action**: Click "Approve" or "Reject" with reason
4. **Order Completion**: Once approved, if fully paid, order status becomes completed

## Business Rules Enforced

✅ **All discount payments require approval**  
✅ **Discount applied on subtotal only (before GST)**  
✅ **GST recalculated on discounted amount**  
✅ **Exact payment amount stored in database**  
✅ **Clear audit trail with approval notes**  
✅ **Order completion only after payment approval**  

## Example Scenario:
- **Order Total**: ₹315 (Subtotal: ₹300 + GST: ₹15)
- **Discount Applied**: ₹15
- **Calculation**:
  - New Subtotal: ₹300 - ₹15 = ₹285
  - New GST: ₹285 × 5% = ₹14.25
  - **Final Payment**: ₹299.25
- **Status**: Pending approval
- **After Approval**: Payment Status = 1, Order completed if fully paid

## Security & Compliance
- Prevents unauthorized discounts from completing orders
- Maintains proper approval hierarchy
- Provides audit trail for all discount transactions
